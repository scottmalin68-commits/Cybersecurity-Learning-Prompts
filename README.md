# Cybersecurity Learning Prompt Library

### By Scott Malin — Cybersecurity & Automation Architect

Interactive, gamified cybersecurity learning experiences that build intuition, sharpen reasoning, and teach security concepts through hands‑on exploration and challenge.

---

## ⭐ Featured Learning Experience

### **Cyberscam Survival Simulator.md**

**Goal:** Teach users to identify, resist, and analyze social engineering attacks through an adaptive, branching simulation.

**What you’ll experience:**
- Realistic scam scenarios with escalating pressure  
- Decision‑driven outcomes that adapt to user choices  
- Embedded reasoning challenges that reinforce safe behavior  

---

## 🎓 Featured Workshop

### **Signal vs Noise – Team Adversarial Judgment Workshop.md**

**Goal:** Train teams to collaboratively distinguish meaningful security signals from irrelevant noise through structured adversarial reasoning.

**Best for:**
- Security teams  
- SOC analysts  
- Red/Blue/Purple team exercises  
- Classroom or corporate training environments  

**Participants will:**
- Identify true indicators of compromise  
- Challenge assumptions and justify reasoning  
- Communicate uncertainty effectively  
- Collaborate under time pressure  

Pairs well with the **Adversarial Judgment Trainer** for pre‑work or follow‑up practice.
