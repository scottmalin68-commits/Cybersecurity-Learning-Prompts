Version: 1.3.0 – Fun-Focused Consumer Polish

## Purpose of v1.3.0
Refine for standalone consumer enjoyment: low-stress fun, hopeful daily habit-building, replayable without pressure. Emphasize personal growth, light warmth/humor (toggleable), family/guest modes, and endless mode after mastery. Avoid enterprise features (no risk scores, leaderboards, mandatory quotas, compliance tracking).

## Purpose of Earlier Versions (Summary)
- v1.2.0: Introduced cert-style progression rewarding real-world-safe habits (patterns over perfection, failure as progress, game-like achievements).
- v1.2.1: Hardened with persistence rules, unique scenario enforcement, glossary definitions, disqualifier forgiveness, anti-gaming diversity minimum (70%), Balanced Re-entry path for over-cautious players.

## Core Rules – Retained & Reinforced
### Persistence & Tracking
- All progress saved per user account, persists across sessions/devices.
- Incomplete scenarios do not count.
- Optional local-only Guest Mode (no save, quick family/friend sessions; provisional/certifications marked until account-linked).

### Scenario Counting Rules
- Scenarios must be unique within a level’s requirement set unless tagged “Replayable for Practice” (max 20% of required count per level).
- Single scenario may count toward multiple levels if it meets criteria for each.
- Internal “used for level X” flag prevents double-dipping within same level.
- At least 70% of scenarios for any level from different templates/pools (anti-cherry-picking).

### Key Term Definitions (Glossary)
- Catastrophic failure: Shares credentials, downloads/clicks malicious payload, sends money, grants remote access.
- Blindly trust branding alone: Proceeds based only on logo/domain/sender name without secondary check.
- Verification via known channel: Uses second pre-trusted method (call known number, separate app/site login, different-channel colleague check).
- Explicitly resists escalation: Chooses de-escalate/question/exit option under pressure.
- Sunk-cost behavior: Continues after red flags due to prior investment.
- Mixed-reality scenarios: Include both legitimate and fraudulent messages (player distinguishes).
- Prompt (verification avoidance): In-game hint/pop-up (e.g., “This looks urgent—want to double-check?”) after suspicious action/inaction.

### Disqualifier Reset & Forgiveness
- Disqualifiers reset after earning current level.
- Level 5 over-avoidance resets after 2 successful legitimate-message handles.
- One “learning grace” per level: first disqualifier triggers gentle reflection (not block).

### Anti-Gaming & Anti-Paranoia Safeguards
- Minimal unique scenario requirement (70% diversity).
- Over-cautious path: ≥3 legit blocks/reports unlocks “Balanced Re-entry” mini-scenarios (low-stakes legit interactions); 2 successes halve over-avoidance counter.
- No certification if <50% of available scenario pool completed.

## Certification Reveal Moments
- Pause gameplay briefly (end-of-session or after qualifying scenario; player choice).
- Short (2–3 sentences), human, affirming—no confetti/loud celebration.
- Example (Level 2): “Certification Unlocked: Verification Ready. You don’t just trust what’s in front of you—you check it. That habit alone prevents a huge number of real-world scams.”

## Post-Mastery: Endless Mode

- No pressure—streaks reset on break without punishment.

## Humor & Warmth Layer (Optional Toggle: Chill Mode)
- Off by default.
- Witty narration: “This ‘urgent IRS’ email is serving vintage 90s vibes—classic!”
- Gentle roasts/reveals: “You paused and checked. Scammers hate that energy.”
- Dad-joke level, affirming, never mean or scary.

## Real-Life "Win" Moments
- After strong sessions/unlocks/streaks: Optional encouragement pop-up.
- Examples: “Nailed that one! Spotted anything sketchy in your real inbox today? High-five yourself if you paused.” / “Your verification habit is paying off IRL—keep that calm radar on!”

## Family / Shared Play Vibes
- Guest Mode: No account/save; quick group play.
- Shared Summary: “Tonight’s family Scam Surf: Everyone spotted the fake urgent call! High-fives all around.”
- Auto-scales difficulty for mixed groups.

## Minimal Visual / Audio Polish
- Audio: Calm lo-fi during pauses; upbeat “aha!” sting on smart choices (toggleable).
- UI: Friendly cartoon scam-villain mascots (goofy, not scary); green checkmarks.
- Accessibility: High-contrast, larger text, voice-over friendly.

## Avoid Enterprise Traps
- No risk scores, dashboards, quotas, punishing streaks, leaderboards.
- Sharing optional/cosmetic only.
- Offline-capable where possible (privacy-first).

## Progress Visibility Rules
- Show current certification at session start.
- No progress bars/percentages/“failed” messages.
- Progress implied through play; end-of-session summaries gentle.

## End-of-Session Summary
- Current level + one contributing behavior + one next-habit nudge.
- Endless Mode: Include streak/cosmetic tease + real-life encouragement.
- Example: “Solid session—you’re staying calm under pressure. Your 5-day streak is looking strong! Maybe check your real messages with that same cool head today?”

- Core mechanics language-agnostic where possible.
- WCAG-friendly text/UI options.
